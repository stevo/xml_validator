you will need libxml to use it so you have to install it by using command:
gem install libxml-ruby

if your OS is windows then this command will not work correctly and you have to go to this site:
http://www.movesonrails.com/articles/2007/10/09/libxml-ruby-and-windows
and download and unpack http://www.movesonrails.com/files/libxml-ruby-windows.zip file into your ruby directory and after that use command: gem install libxml-ruby
